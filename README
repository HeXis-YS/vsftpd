What is this?
=============

vsftpd is an FTP server, or daemon. The "vs" stands for Very Secure. Obviously
this is not a guarantee, but a reflection that I have written the entire
codebase with security in mind, and carefully designed the program to be
resilient to attack.

Recent evidence suggests that vsftpd is also extremely fast (and this is
before any explicit performance tuning!) In tests against wu-ftpd, vsftpd
was always faster, supporting over twice as many users in some tests.

Note - this is currently very much a work in progress, so some areas of the
source are a bit of a mess. Please don't take this as indicative of the
quality of my completed work ;-)

This document will be expanded in a future release!
