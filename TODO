CRITICAL
========

NOT SO CRITICAL
===============

- IPv6 support
- "make install" should install man pages

ON THE BACK BURNER
==================

- "Minimal" build support
- Small race: signal might come in just before we start a blocking call
- Support for "welcome.msg" on initial connection
- wtmp support
- OpenSSL support
- transparent compression support
- transparent tar support

NOT PLANNED
===========

- syslog() support - I don't want to encourage the broken beast
- telnet strings (no demand)
- better pattern matching in "ls" (no demand)
- standalone support (no demand, connections not a bottleneck)
