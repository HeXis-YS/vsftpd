CRITICAL
========

NOT SO CRITICAL
===============

- status 500 instead of 550 for denied commands is confusing some clients
- separate upload/download max rates
- select() is assuming Linux behaviour (not threatening stability)
- IPv6 support
- multiline support in welcome banner

ON THE BACK BURNER
==================

- transfer stats
- Small race: signal might come in just before we start a blocking call
- Support for "welcome.msg" on initial connection
- wtmp support
- OpenSSL support
- transparent compression support
- transparent tar support

NOT PLANNED
===========

- syslog() support - I don't want to encourage the broken beast
- telnet strings (no demand)
- better pattern matching in "ls" (no demand)
- standalone support (no demand, connections not a bottleneck)
- "Minimal" build support
